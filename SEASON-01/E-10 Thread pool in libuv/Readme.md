🧠 What is a Thread Pool?

A thread pool is a group of pre-created threads that can run tasks concurrently (in parallel).
Instead of creating a new thread every time you need to perform a background operation, Node.js reuses existing threads from this pool.

Think of it like:

🧵 “A team of 4 workers ready to do background jobs while the manager (main thread) keeps handling other tasks.”

⚙️ Why Thread Pool Exists in Node.js

Node.js is designed to be non-blocking — it uses an event loop on a single main thread.
But certain tasks cannot be done asynchronously by just the event loop — for example:

File system operations (fs.readFile, fs.writeFile)

DNS lookups

Compression (zlib)

Crypto (like crypto.pbkdf2)

Some network operations

👉 These heavy operations are offloaded to the thread pool, so the main thread stays free to handle other tasks.

🧩 Thread Pool in Node.js Internals

Managed by libuv (a C library under Node.js)

Default thread pool size: 4 threads

🔍 Is Node.js Single-Threaded or Multi-Threaded?

Answer:

Node.js is single-threaded in terms of JavaScript execution,
but multi-threaded under the hood because of the libuv thread pool.
it depends upon what code we are writing then it will be single or multi threaed , like synch code writing then single threaded but heavy task like dns , crypto , file read doing then multi threaded bcz thsese are done by thread pool .

🧾 Summary (Simplified Flow):
Step	Component	Action
1	Call Stack	Executes synchronous code
2	libuv	Sends fs.readFile to thread pool
3	Thread Pool	Performs file I/O in background
4	libuv	Pushes callback into poll queue after file read completes
5	Event Loop	Picks callback when poll phase runs
6	Call Stack	Executes callback function

🧩 Key Points to Remember

Thread pool only handles heavy/blocking tasks (like file system, crypto, DNS).

Event loop doesn’t do the I/O — it just schedules callbacks when I/O is finished.

Callback always runs back on the main thread (not in the worker thread).

Thread pool and event loop work together — event loop is the manager; thread pool is the workers.
